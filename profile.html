        <i>Code Plateau is one of the best thing that i have encountered. so far i have </br>
            understood the fundamentals and basic of software programming and its applications 
            in real life.</br>
            I have understood that every automated device has some series of instruction (programs)</br>
            that is activating them.<br>
            So far learning about gitHub is one of the interesting and challenging part of being a </br>
            software developer. At some point it seems challenging beacuse of most terms and technicality </br>
            in understanding some of those terms, but with the way and manner the instructors about the <br>
            whole training the coast will be clearer.
