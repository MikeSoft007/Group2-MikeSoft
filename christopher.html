My name is Christopher Stephen a member of group 2
My experience at code plateau state program: The first day i started the program,i had challenges with my laptop. But i was able to fixed the problem and everything is working perfectly now. am really developing interest on the program and also like the ways the instructors are teaching us. May God bless the Plateau State government for creating this opportunity to us to learn. Thanks
